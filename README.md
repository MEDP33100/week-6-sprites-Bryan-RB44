### Assignment

Create an webpage that fetches data from an external source and visually represents each data item as a sprite. You’ll use JavaScript classes to manage the sprites, and for an added challenge, you can animate them using CSS or GSAP.

**Requirements**

1. **Fetch Data**:
    - Use JavaScript to retrieve data from an external source (a JSON file). Create your own data set in JSON format and add it to your project folder. (Note: you can use AI to help you generate a dataset in JSON. For example, you can prompt ChatGPT: “Create me a  test dataset of different songs in JSON format”).
    - Use `fetch()` to get the data from your JSON file and turn in into a Javascript object (use Class 5 lecture / the library class exercise as a reference)
2. **Render Sprites**:
    
    Use the fetched data to create sprites (visual representations of each item). The sprites must be managed through a **JavaScript class**, which defines their properties and behavior (use Class 5 lecture / library class example as a reference).
    
3. **Optional Animation**:
    
    For an extra challenge, animate the sprites using the GSAP library. The animation could include movements, rotations, or scaling effects.
